# Trivia VueJS

A browser based trivia game made with VueJS and the open trivia database.
it is currently only styled for mobile.


I made this because I like to play a trivia game sometimes, but I couldn't find a simple one that wasn't loaded with ads and social integrations and crap.


All questions and categories come from the [open trivia database](opentdb.com), which is super awesome! High quality questions, I was able to just focus on the front-end.

This is the MVP, more to come in the future.
